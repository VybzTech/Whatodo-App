# Whatodo

### v1.0

A new Flutter application that handles task management and todo tracking within your reach. Consider expressing yourself in different personalities and achieving you ability to seamlessly transistion between the things you should be doing as your daily goals. That is what we offer with task color categorization, setting priorit of Tasks alongside sub-tasks, recurring mode, dependencies and of course, a due date. There are designs for a future model but it will be in a different version.

# Getting Started

This project is a starting point for my Flutter journey and I DO NOT have any access to a developer account in Google Play since I have just the apk you can follow the link to download it from my github

## WHATODO's Capabilities

Certainly there are a few things that are definitely missing, but here are some of the few features my first Flutter project enumerated utilising free resources:

- Local Phone Data Storage using Hive box regardless of user changes.
- App State Management using Cubit Provider
- Notify Users when an important action has been taken
- Create and Recreate User profile for Saved tasks
- Display date and time with beautiful Montserrat and Sans fonts.
